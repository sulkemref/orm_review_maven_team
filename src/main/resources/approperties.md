# spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/orm_review

is used to configure the database connection properties for a Spring Boot application.

In particular, this statement sets the URL of the PostgreSQL database that the application will connect to.
The format of the URL is jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/orm_review, where:

* jdbc:postgresql:// is the prefix that specifies the JDBC driver for PostgreSQL
* localhost is the hostname of the PostgreSQL server
* 5432 is the port number on which the PostgreSQL server is listening
* orm_review is the name of the PostgreSQL database that the application will use
  By setting this URL in the application.properties file, Spring Boot will use it to create a connection to the specified
  PostgreSQL database. The other properties that are typically set in the application.properties file for a database
  connection include the username and password to use for authentication, as well as any other driver-specific properties
  that are required.

Overall, the statement spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/orm_review in the application.properties
file is an important configuration setting for a Spring Boot application that needs to connect to a PostgreSQL database.

# spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
in the application.properties file is used to configure the Hibernate dialect for the PostgreSQL database.

In particular, this statement specifies the PostgreSQLDialect implementation of the Hibernate dialect for PostgreSQL.
The Hibernate dialect is responsible for translating the Hibernate query language (HQL) to the native SQL of the
underlying database. By setting the PostgreSQLDialect implementation, Hibernate will use the correct syntax and language
features for the PostgreSQL database.

The spring.jpa.database-platform property is used to specify the database dialect in a Spring Boot application that uses
JPA with Hibernate. When Hibernate is used as the JPA implementation, Spring Boot will automatically configure the
dialect based on the database driver class in the classpath. However, in some cases, you may need to explicitly set the
dialect using this property, especially if you are using a non-standard driver or configuration.

Overall, the statement spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect in the
application.properties file is an important configuration setting for a Spring Boot application that uses JPA with
Hibernate and needs to connect to a PostgreSQL database. It ensures that the correct Hibernate dialect is used to
communicate with the database, enabling Hibernate to translate HQL queries into the appropriate native SQL syntax for
PostgreSQL.

# spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
in the application.properties file is used to configure the Hibernate behavior for database schema generation during
application startup.

In particular, this statement specifies that Hibernate should generate the database schema by executing the CREATE
script for each entity in the application. This means that whenever the application starts up, Hibernate will create the
necessary database tables and columns based on the entity definitions in the application.

The spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto property is used to specify the behavior of Hibernate during schema generation in a
Spring Boot application that uses JPA with Hibernate. There are several options that can be used with this property,
including:

* create: Hibernate will create the database schema during application startup. If the schema already exists, it will be
  dropped and recreated.
* update: Hibernate will update the database schema during application startup based on any changes in the entity
  definitions. This option will not modify existing columns, but may add new columns or tables.
* validate: Hibernate will validate the database schema during application startup, but will not make any modifications
  to the schema.
* none: Hibernate will not perform any schema generation or validation during application startup.

It's important to note that using ddl-auto=create can be dangerous in production environments, as it can cause data
loss or corruption if used incorrectly. This is because the existing database schema will be dropped and recreated every
time the application starts up. Therefore, it is recommended to use update or validate in production environments, or to
manage schema changes manually.

Overall, the statement spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create in the application.properties file is an important
configuration setting for a Spring Boot application that uses JPA with Hibernate and needs to generate the database
schema automatically during application startup.

# spring.sql.init.mode=always
in the application.properties file is used to configure the behavior of SQL initialization scripts during application
startup.

In particular, this statement specifies that SQL initialization scripts should always be executed during application
startup, regardless of whether the database schema has already been created. This means that whenever the application
starts up, the specified SQL scripts will be executed, potentially modifying the database schema or inserting data into
the database.

The spring.sql.init.mode property is used to specify the behavior of SQL initialization scripts in a Spring Boot
application. There are several options that can be used with this property, including:

* always: SQL initialization scripts will always be executed during application startup, regardless of whether the
  database schema has already been created.
* embedded: SQL initialization scripts will only be executed if the database is an embedded database.
* never: SQL initialization scripts will never be executed during application startup.
  It's important to note that using spring.sql.init.mode=always can be dangerous in production environments, as it can
  cause data loss or corruption if used incorrectly. This is because the specified SQL scripts will be executed every time
  the application starts up, potentially modifying the database schema or inserting duplicate data into the database.

Overall, the statement spring.sql.init.mode=always in the application.properties file is an important configuration
setting for a Spring Boot application that needs to execute SQL initialization scripts during application startup,
regardless of the current state of the database schema.

# spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true
in the application.properties file is used to defer the initialization of the datasource until the Hibernate/JPA schema
is created.

In particular, this statement specifies that the initialization of the datasource should be deferred until the
Hibernate/JPA schema is created. This means that the connection to the database will not be established until after the
Hibernate/JPA schema is created, which can improve application startup times.

The spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization property is used to specify whether the datasource initialization should
be deferred in a Spring Boot application that uses JPA with Hibernate. By default, this property is set to false, which
means that the datasource is initialized before the Hibernate/JPA schema is created.

When this property is set to true, the datasource initialization is deferred until after the Hibernate/JPA schema is
created. This can be useful in situations where the database is slow to start up or where there are connectivity issues.

It's important to note that setting spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true can cause issues if there are any
database connectivity issues during the Hibernate/JPA schema creation process. If the database cannot be connected to,
then the schema creation will fail, and the application will not start.

Overall, the statement spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true in the application.properties file is an
important configuration setting for a Spring Boot application that uses JPA with Hibernate and needs to improve
application startup times by deferring the initialization of the datasource until after the Hibernate/JPA schema is
created.
